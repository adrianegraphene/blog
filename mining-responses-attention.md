# Mining for Responses and Attention vs. Mining for Bitcoin

You've heared of "Mining Bitcoin", but have you heard of "Mining Responses" or "Mining Attention"?

I guarantee you've experienced it! All those unknown phone calls, unwanted texts, emails, DMs on social media / chat applications are the symptom of people trying to mine your attention. So who's making the money here and why isn't it you?

## Why is this an issue?

1. More businesses are created everyday. Those businesses want your feedback so they can grow and beat the incumbent players in their space.
![From messages to entertainment... Here's a small chart of all the different ways our attention gets used every minute! It shows things such as 15.2 million texts and 210 million emails sent every minute](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pitch-deck/FynCom_PitchDeck_Q32022-Rewards_Page_02.png)

2. Technological tools/services are making it 10x easier for businessses to automate sequences of emails, calls, texts, DMs, etc. to their "prospects". These sequences can have anywhere from 6 to 20 actions associated with them.

The exponential rise in our technology and simliar rise in population of people/businesses make it incredibly difficult for even the best national institutions to get the responses they used to get. 
![This shows an average 56% decline in response rates over 20 years from national institutes like the American National Election Studies and Pew Research Center](https://fyncom-static-files.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/pitch-deck/FynCom_PitchDeck_Q32022-Rewards_Page_03.png)

## Why should I care?

You know that thing about scarcity and value? Well, if responses are becoming scarce, shouldn't we be able to value them? Isn't there an opportunity here, where **you can choose to monetize your responses or price your attention so high** that not even the biggest spenders have a chance at contacting you?

In this world, how do you let "legitimate" messages from friends/family/businesses reach you without paying?
